<!--
Try to turn this into a "catch the rabbit" game where the rabbit appears to 
"move" one space to the right whenever you mouse over it. After 4 attempts 
to mouse over, it should show the "No Easter Eggs" message. After 20 attempts, 
it should show "Humans are slow!!!". Put all your code in a .js file that is
loaded from the <head> element.

Hint: Use visibility:hidden and visibility:visible to hide/show the rabbit 
images. For the messages, you could use visibility, or the display property 
(set to "none" or ""), or you could set the colors to make them appear and
disappear.
